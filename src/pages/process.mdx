## A safe and secure path towards a better future.

HanVoice is a charity that helps North Korean refugees resettle in Canada. Once you register with HanVoice, **we will securely send your family's information to field partners.** If your family is identified and meet specific conditions, we will contact you to fill out the _refugee application form_.

Please note that HanVoice nor our partners can guarantee that we will be able to successfully locate, rescue, or resettle your family in Canada. Our role as a charity is limited to facilitating your familyâ€™s potential resettlement from Southeast Asia to Canada. Under Canadian law, HanVoice cannot provide money or support for the escape and rescue of your family.

The process of applying for refugee status in Canada from transit countries can take between three to six months or more, but this can vary. If you have questions about processing times, please contact us and we can discuss further.

The main applicant must be a North Korean woman, who has been victim, or is at risk of, sexual and gender-based violence. She must not have lived in South Korea before. The main applicantâ€™s family members can include their spouse and dependent children.

In some cases, other family members may be able to apply to come to Canada later under the One Year Window program. This program allows family members who did not travel to Canada with the Principal Applicant to apply to come to Canada within one year of the Principal Applicant arriving.
